This project contains an analysis of the bicycle parking infrastructure in the Loire-Atlantique area, France. The aim is to provide insights into geospatial distribution, capacity utilization, and opportunities for infrastructure improvement across several municipalities in the region.

## Project Files
- `Geospatial Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the geospatial analysis and capacity visualization.
- `hotel de vile stationement.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with detailed descriptive and infrastructure analysis.
- `Report.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the key findings.
- `244400644_stationnements_cyclables.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (sourced from Hotel de Ville Saint-Nazaire).

## Key Insights:
- **Capacity Distribution**: Most bicycle parking locations in the Loire-Atlantique area have a small capacity, with the largest facility holding 48 bicycles.
- **Geospatial Distribution**: High-density areas are well-served, while some suburban areas show a lack of parking infrastructure.
- **Temporal Trends**: Significant infrastructure updates occurred in September 2022, with steady maintenance efforts in 2023.
